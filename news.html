									        <p>More young Hongkongers dream of swapping at least a few months for more fulfilling work overseas and it seems that the interest has been on the rise. </p></br>
							                        <p>According to <a href="http://www.lwb.gov.hk/eng/legco/lwb-l-e-2017.pdf">the statistics from Labour Department</a>, since 2001, when Hong Kong government has established working holiday scheme(WHS), there have been more than  85,000 people aged from 18 to 30 participating in the scheme. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Under <a href="http://www.whs.gov.hk/en/workingholiday-overseas.php">the government’s working holiday scheme</a>, young locals are allowed to visit one of 13 partner countries (including Japan, South Korea, Austria, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, England, Canada, Sweden, Germany, France, Hungry and the Netherland) for at least six months for work and pleasure. </p></br>

				                                                <p>A slower pace of life, accessible visas, better quality of life and larger activity spaces make those partner countries appealing for Hongkongers looking for a new place to live and work. </p></br>

	                                                                        <p>The new figures from the cost of living experts <a href="https://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/index/asia"> Expatistan.com </a> showed that Hong Kong is the most expensive city in Asia, with soaring rent above Singapore and Tokyo. The city is also ranked as 14th most expensive city in the world after Expatistan compared information from almost 261,000 users around the world to calculate average prices in 2,200 cities.</p></br>
                                                                                <p>Janis Wong Yi-ching, 28, said: “I was suffocated and lost when I suffered from the long working hours and without enough rest time in Hong Kong. Seriously, I was half alive but I felt mostly dead while working hard just to earn a living.” </p></br>
                                                                                <p>She said, “Hong Kong people probably have the world’s worst work-life balance, most of whom do not even know how to enjoy the moment they’re in. And this is the major reason why I work overseas. I want to live my life to the fullest instead of earning reputation or money pointlessly.” </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Wong, a current working holidaymaker in the United Kingdom, said she was tired of being stuck in a rut with no chance of promotion in Hong Kong’s Island Shangri-La; therefore she quitted her hospitality job to set off on a journey. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>When Wong was a receptionist in a Hong Kong-based luxury hotel, she claimed that she worked extra hours almost every single working day. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>She said, she was very decisive about what she was going to do so she joined the working holiday scheme shortly after quitting her job she had worked for more than five years. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Her relevant work experience and diligence enabled herself to find a front-desk position in a Scotland-based hotel along with a comprehensive employee benefits package. </p></br>
                                                                                               
                                                                                <p>However, the avid 29-year-old explorer Wong wanted to expand her horizons more this year by joining another newly launched working scheme to Sweden since her working visa is about to expire. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Wong is set to continue her next adventure in the coming July, saying that “I don’t want to be stuck in the bustling city, Hong Kong and earn hard just for paying the rent. I’m still young. I need to enjoy the most precious moment of my life.” </p></br>
                                                                                <p>When it comes to the benefits brought from working holiday, Dr Horiuchi indicated that leaving the city to explore the outside world might be regarded as a better prospect, especially for young Hongkongers. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>“International exposure has always been considered by Hong Kong people, including young ones as very important,” the academic continued. “I believe this is exactly what makes Hong Kong unique and different from many other Chinese cities.” </p></br>
                                                                                           
                                                                                <p>Dorothy Cho Ka-yan, three years ago, decided to leave the city for a year to refresh her minds and gain some international exposures at her age of 30. She now is a public relation manager. </p></br>
                                                                                <a href ="cho.html"><p><font face="verdana"><b> “Lucky” girl got her first management job in Hong Kong after working holiday  &#8594; </b></font></p></a>

                                                                                <p>She said, “I was actually benefited from this unique working experience after getting back to Hong Kong and looking for the full-time job.” </p></br>
                                                                                <p>“I quickly got my public relation management job at NGO (Non-governmental organisation) because my employer thought I not only had relevant experience in communication but also had overseas editing experience,” she continued.</p></br>
                                                                                <p>Jodi Johnstone, a human resource manager of <a href="https://trevelyan.co.nz/"> Trevelyan’s </a>, thought that the working holidayers had a positive attitude and nice personality in general, saying “people from Hong Kong are amazing and fit in well with the team.” </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Trevelyan’s is a New Zealand-based packhouse and cool storage company providing support for kiwifruit and avocado industries. The firm hires around 1,600 workers for only three to four months of a year, especially during Kiwifruit season from March to June while working holidayers are their important human resources, Johnstone said. </p></br>

                                                                                <p>“Most of the horticulture business in New Zealand hire working holidayers and most of the jobs here are NZ$16.5 (around HK$92) plus eight percent holiday pay which is around the country’s minimum wage,” she continued. “We’re happy to work with them because they’re hard-working and cheerful all the times.” </p></br>
                                                                                <p>However, on the other side of the globe, the employer from Ireland had different perspectives on hiring and accommodating young working holidayers from Hong Kong. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Jackie Ho, the Chinese-Irish restaurant owner of  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lanternballina/"> the Lantern Chinese Restaurant & Take Away</a>, said he had several terrible experiences with hiring wrong candidates from Hong Kong, which left a bad impression on him. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>“Hongkongers are so cunning. They’re difficult people who constantly find excuses to not do their tasks and tend to push off responsibilities that they don’t like doing,” said Ho who was born in Hong Kong and moved to the Ballina town in Ireland since he was five together with his family. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>“This high-end restaurant is family owned and operated, known for its signature dish ‘Chicken Dry Hot & Spicy’. Most people sometimes drive all the way long to my place just for this special delicacy. So the workers I hired must be well-trained while serving customers to ensure both food and service quality,” he said. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Founded by his father Sunny Ho in 1986, the restaurant is now taken over by Jackie Ho after his family returned to Hong Kong to seek a culturally similar life in retirement. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>He would post a job on the Facebook group called Ireland Working Holiday which serves as the platform of choice for both employees and employers to exchange information. “I prefer recruiting Taiwanese working holidayers because they’re more hospitable and hard-working,” Ho said. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Though employers and employees hold different points of view on work, the working holiday scheme is not all about work and no play. The scheme is made for participants who want to work and travel abroad and earn money to support their travel plans. A former participant Lee Kai-wai and a current working holiday maker Kun On-dik just nailed their plans. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Lee Ka-wai, 33, a former working holidaymaker, described himself as a wanderlust, saying that his hunger to explore simply could not be quenched no matter how many vacations or journeys he takes.</p></br>

                                                                                <p>“I think I am born to travel,” he added. Just during one-year working holiday journey, he travelled to more than 20 cities and joined the breathtaking festivals and celebrations around Europe.</p></br>
                                                                                <p>“Working holiday is not about either work or vacation. It should be a combination of travel and work. Every penny working holidayers earn from their works should be counted as a travel budget,” Lee said. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Kun On-dik, 23, is an example who combined work with pleasure. She has worked solidly as a part-time tour guide for a Chinese travel agency based in Scotland for nine months after the university, with the intention of saving to travel across Europe before working in the UK. </p></br>
                                                                                <a href ="kun.html"><p><font face="verdana"><b> Get paid to travel: become a tour leader &#8594; </b></font></p></a>

I’ve had this idea planted in my mind when I was still in the secondary school,” she said. “ I’d never thought of getting paid to travel somewhere I like or even working outside of Hong Kong.” Up to now, she has travelled to more than 25 European cities.</p></br>
                                                                                <p>Instead of strenuous works and a travel itch, Alex Lai Ming-yip, a former working holidayer, had a greater passion for sharing coffee in different workshops that reach out to the community during his 16-month working holiday journey. </p></br>
                                                                                <a href ="alex.html"><p><font face="verdana"><b> Brew with heart: a chance for the coffee exchange &#8594; </b></font></p></a>

                                                                                <p>Lai said, “I want to share the love of coffee with people I don’t know, which helps me get closer to other people and let the others know the attraction of coffee.”</p></br>
                                                                                <p>“When you express the passion, you actually inspire people around you. And the magical thing is that when you inspire other people, they also inspire you or even give you an innovation in coffee,” he added. </p></br>

									<p>Melissa is a final-year International Journalism student of Hong Kong Baptist University. She is now in her 20s and in love with travelling. After going to Sweden as an exchange student in 2016, she suddenly realised the importance of a work-life balance which is something Hongkongers have been struggling with for years.
