                        <p>Under <a href="http://www.whs.gov.hk/en/workingholiday-overseas.php" target="_blank">the government’s working holiday scheme</a>, young locals are allowed to visit one of 13 partner countries (including Japan, South Korea, Austria, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, England, Canada, Sweden, Germany, France, Hungry and the Netherland) for at least six months for work and pleasure. </p></br>

                        <p>According to <a href="http://www.lwb.gov.hk/eng/legco/lwb-l-e-2017.pdf" target="_blank">the statistics from Labour Department</a>, there have been more than 85,000 people aged from 18 to 30 participating in the working holiday scheme(WHS) since its launch in 2001. </p><br>

                        <p>Chak Wong, the commissioner for labour said that the scheme provided young people with a chance to enjoy holidaying and working abroad as well as strengthen cultural exchange. </p><br>
                        <p>“The Labour Department has been actively seeking the establishment of new WHS arrangements with more economies and expansion of the annual quota with the governments of existing WHS partner economies, so as to give Hong Kong youths more opportunities to choose and participate in WHS,” Wong said. </p><br>

                    <p>A slower pace of life, accessible visas, better quality of life and larger activity spaces make those partner countries appealing for Hongkongers looking for a new place to live and work. </p></br>
                    <p>Dr Toru Horiuchi, an associate programme director of Global Studies in the Faculty of Social Science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said: “more young people want to get away from the polarizing political environment and a stressful city at least for a while.”  </p></br>
                    
                             
                    <p>The new figures from the cost of living experts <a href="https://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/index/asia" target="_blank"> Expatistan.com </a> showed that Hong Kong is the most expensive city in Asia, with soaring rent above Singapore and Tokyo. The city is also ranked as 14th most expensive city in the world after Expatistan compared information from almost 261,000 users around the world to calculate average prices in 2,200 cities.</p></br>
                            
                    <p>Janis Wong Yi-ching, 28, said: “I was suffocated and lost when I suffered from the long working hours and without enough rest time in Hong Kong. Seriously, I was half alive but I felt mostly dead while working hard just to earn a living.” </p></br>
                                                                                
                   <p>Wong, a current working holidaymaker in the United Kingdom, said she was tired of being stuck in a rut with no chance of promotion and overworking in Hong Kong’s Island Shangri-La; therefore she quitted her hospitality job and to set off on a journey.</p></br>
                                                                                
                    <p>Her relevant work experience and diligence enabled herself to find a front-desk position in a Scotland-based hotel along with a comprehensive employee benefits package. </p></br>
                                                                                               
                                                                                
                    <p>When it comes to the benefits brought from working holiday, Dr Horiuchi indicated that leaving the city to explore the outside world might be regarded as a better prospect, especially for young Hongkongers. </p></br>

                    <p>“International exposure has always been considered by Hong Kong people, including young ones as very important,” the academic continued. “I believe this is exactly what makes Hong Kong unique and different from many other Chinese cities.” </p></br>
                
                    
                    <p>“I got a theatre job after about a month and decided I wanted to stay here to take in the culture and keep the connections the company gave me,” said Bonnie Chan, a Hongkonger who joined working holiday scheme in 2016 in London. Her experience led to her choosing Royal Central School of Speech and Drama to study master programme in theatre criticism and dramaturgy. </p><br>

                    <p> She worked in the Royal Shakespeare Company which is one of the best British theatres. She said that the working holiday visa did afford her the opportunity to establish herself and get a taste of the country before committing to it as a study and career development destination. </p><br>

                    <br><br>

                    <p>After a few months living in London, Chan created a Facebook fan page called Bits in Britain in March, 2016 to record her working holiday life outside Hong Kong, currently with a thousand followers. </p><br> 
                    
                    <p>However, not all working holiday makers could be given a chance at success. Lam Tat-wai was treated unfairly when looking for a shop assistant job as his first job in Ireland. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Lam got turned down because he “could not offer the recruiter a PPS(Personal Public Service)  number.”</p><br>

                    <p>According to the Irish Citizens Information Phone Service (CIPS), everyone who works in Ireland should have specific personal public service number. It is a unique reference number that helps workers access public services, social welfare benefits and information in Ireland.</p><br>

                    <p>Although the official website stated that employers should not look for a job seeker’s PPS number when recruiting, Lam said, “without PPS (Personal Public Service) number, it’s quite hard to find a job. So when I first came to Ireland, I could not but to work for Chinese people.”</p><br>

                    <p>“The experience was quite frustrating at first. But I know many working holidayer must come across negativity and bias during their journeys, you just need to get over it on your own,” he added. </p><br>

                    <p>Lam whose working holiday visa expired in 2016 has been offered a work permit by the international logistics firm in Shannon.</p><br>

                    <a href ="lam.html"><p><font face="verdana"><b> Home and away: getting a work permit and stay on  &#8594; </b></font></p></a>

                    <p>Lam is the only one who used to experience unfair treatment by an employer. Australia has been reported that the problem of exploitation has been getting more serious in recent years. </p><br>
                    
                    <p> The <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1617/Quick_Guides/WorkingHoliday" target="_blank">2016 document from the Parliament of Australia</a> stated that the exploitation of some working holiday makers, especially those from non English-speaking countries had been a topic of intense public concern for years. The problems include underpayment of wages, overworking, living in substandard accommodation.</p><br>
 
                    <p>Another <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Education_and_Employment/temporary_work_visa/Report" target="_blank">national report in 2016</a> revealed that workers from Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea with low English language proficiency were more likely to be exploited. </p><br>
             
                    <p> Lam said, “the problem of exploitation happens everywhere. But I think most working holiday makers who leave their home cities focus on gaining valuable experience rather than money. Underpayment is still acceptable if you are a newcomer.” </p><br>


                 
                    <p>Jodi Johnstone, a human resource manager of <a href="https://trevelyan.co.nz/" target="_blank"> Trevelyan’s </a>, thought that the working holidayers had a positive attitude and nice personality in general, saying “people from Hong Kong are amazing and fit in well with the team.” </p></br>

                    <p>Trevelyan’s is a New Zealand-based packhouse and cool storage company providing support for kiwifruit and avocado industries. The firm hires around 1,600 workers for only three to four months of a year, especially during Kiwifruit season from March to June while working holidayers are their important human resources, Johnstone said. </p></br>

                    <p>“Most of the horticulture business in New Zealand hire working holidayers and most of the jobs here are NZ$16.5 (around HK$92) plus eight percent holiday pay which is around the country’s minimum wage,” she continued. “We’re happy to work with them because they’re hard-working and cheerful all the times.” </p></br>

                    <p>However, on the other side of the globe, the employer from Ireland had different perspectives on hiring and accommodating young working holidayers from Hong Kong. </p></br>

                    <p>Jackie Ho, the Chinese-Irish restaurant owner of  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lanternballina/" target="_blank"> the Lantern Chinese Restaurant & Take Away</a>, said he had several terrible experiences with hiring wrong candidates from Hong Kong, which left a bad impression on him. </p></br>

                    <p>“Hongkongers are so cunning. They’re difficult people who constantly find excuses to not do their tasks and tend to push off responsibilities that they don’t like doing,” said Ho who was born in Hong Kong and moved to the Ballina town in Ireland since he was five together with his family. </p></br>

                    <p>“This high-end restaurant is family owned and operated, known for its signature dish ‘Chicken Dry Hot & Spicy’. Most people sometimes drive all the way long to my place just for this special delicacy. So the workers I hired must be well-trained while serving customers to ensure both food and service quality,” he said. </p></br>

                    <p>Founded by his father Sunny Ho in 1986, the restaurant is now taken over by Jackie Ho after his family returned to Hong Kong to seek a culturally similar life in retirement. </p></br>

                    <p>He would post a job on the Facebook group called Ireland Working Holiday which serves as the platform of choice for both employees and employers to exchange information. “I prefer recruiting Taiwanese working holidayers because they’re more hospitable and hard-working,” Ho said. </p></br>

After going to Sweden as an exchange student in 2016, she suddenly realised the importance of a work-life balance which is something Hongkongers have been struggling with for years. This is how she came up with the idea of honours project: Working Holiday.</p>
