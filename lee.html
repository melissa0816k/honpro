                                                                                <p>Travelling to a foreign country can be daunting if you don’t know the local language, and while Lee Ka-wai, speaks only Cantonese and fair English, he chose Germany as his working destination. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>In 2015, Lee decided to leave everything behind temporarily for a year and challenge himself by going an unfamiliar place: Munich, to work and travel as many cities as he could. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Lee, a freelance magician and part-time tour guide working in Hong Kong after the one-year overseas living experience, is glad he made the move.</p></br>
				                                                <a href ="ng.html"><p><font face="verdana"><b> No regrets abroad: “This is my best decision ever!” &#8594; </b></font></p></a>
                                                                                <p>He said, “I can learn another new language and prove just how adaptable I can be by embracing change and learning to adjust to a different culture.” Lee pointed out that English fluency was not a matter when working in Munich because people there only use German to communicate.</p></br>
                                                                                <p>Described as a wanderlust, Lee said that his hunger to explore simply could not be quenched no matter how many vacations or journeys he takes. “I think I am born to travel,” he added. </p></br>

                                                                                <p>Just during one-year working holiday journey, he travelled to more than 20 cities and joined the breathtaking festivals and celebrations around Europe. “Working holiday is not about either work or vacation. It should be a combination of travel and work. Every penny working holidayers earn from their works should be counted as a travel budget,” he said.</p></br>
                                                                                 <a href ="kun.html"><p><font face="verdana"><b> Get paid to travel: become a tour leader &#8594; </b></font></p></a>

So I’d make good use of some apps in order to cut down on the cost of travelling such as FlixBus, BlaBlaCar and Couchsurfing,” he continued, “But you should be extra cautious about the personal safety, especially if you’re female.”</p></br>
                                                                                <p>Lee, a regular guest speaker invited by the labour department, always holds talks and seminars about his experience of working abroad and tips on working holiday.</p></br>
                                                                                <p>At one of the talks in March, Lee shared his employment experiences in Germany along with some of his friends. He worked for several restaurants, from Chinese, Japanese to American restaurants in Munich. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>“My last boss who is a German thinks Hongkongers are particularly hard-working and diligent so he likes to hire working holidayers from Hong Kong,” he said during the talk.</p></br>
                                                                                <p>Lee, whose the last job was a kitchen job at the burger restaurant in Munich, was even offered an extended work permit to continue his kitchen job. However, he turned the offer down because he thought pan-frying a burger was not his life goal. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>He now leads seasonal tours to some neighbouring countries such as Thailand, Japan and Taiwan and he said he enjoyed that. </p></br>

									<p>Melissa is a final-year International Journalism student of Hong Kong Baptist University. She is now in her 20s and in love with travelling. After going to Sweden as an exchange student in 2016, she suddenly realised the importance of a work-life balance which is something Hongkongers have been struggling with for years. This is how she came up with the idea of honours project: Working Holiday.</p>
