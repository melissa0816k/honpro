                                                                                <p>A man who travelled all the way long to Paris sharing the love of coffee has revealed his 16-month unique working holiday journey. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Alex Lai Ming-yip has an eye for coffee beans, thanks to his sensory analysis training. He also has a greater passion for sharing coffee in different workshops that reach out to the community. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>His true passion appears to be crafting as much as coffee as possible in as many places as he can get to, even in Paris. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Lai said, “I want to share the love of coffee to people I don’t know, which helps me get closer to other people and let the others know the attraction of coffee.”</p></br>
                                                                                <p>“When you express the passion, you actually inspire people around you. And the magical thing is that when you inspire other people, they also inspire you or give you an innovation in coffee,” he continued. </p></br>

He used to hold coffee tasting workshops at his Asian friend’s house, set up a street stall to introduce the coffee beans he bought from Hong Kong and even make coffee on trains. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Opening a box of chosen finest coffee beans, Lai had several experiences in making coffee on trains and asking other passengers to taste his freshly brewed coffee. Lai said, “I want to make my coffee better through others’ comment.”</p></br>
                                                                                <p>“I felt great in my working holiday trip, which has sharpened my coffee-making skills and inspired me how to add a new twist to coffee,” he said, with a satisfactory smile. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Lai is letting his passion for coffee guide her in further developing his dream by partnering with the cafè, Common Room & Co., which serves as a multifunctional place for the neighbours to chit chat while sipping up coffee brewed by Lai. </p></br>

									<p>Melissa is a final-year International Journalism student of Hong Kong Baptist University. She is now in her 20s and in love with travelling. After going to Sweden as an exchange student in 2016, she suddenly realised the importance of a work-life balance which is something Hongkongers have been struggling with for years. This is how she came up with the idea of honours project: Working Holiday.</p>
