										<h2 id="content">A ex-manager quitted the promising job for finding the “life purpose”</h2>
                    <p><b>Reported by Melissa Ko</b></p>
	
									        
                                                                                <p>After working for almost five years in the retail industry and even getting promoted to a district manager, Esther Choi decided to quit her job to “find the meaning” of her life. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>“During five years of working in the real world, I never felt connected to my work although I got promoted and the company improve my salary,” she said. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>She described her previous work life in Hong Kong as pointless and aimless.</p></br>
                                                                          
                                                                                <p>Two years ago, at the age of 25, Choi packed her belongings and headed to Scotland in which she worked as a salesperson, cashier, a waitress and a caregiver. Before kick-starting the new job in Edinburgh, she spent a month travelling around the United Kingdom because she wanted to “take a real break”. </p></br>

                                                                                <p>The former manager first worked in a traditional Scottish clothes store selling cashmere clothing, responsible for convincing the Chinese tourists to buy the products mainly since she could manage to speak Mandarin. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Making the move from the manager to the entry-level salesperson, Choi put a casual smile on her face and said boastfully, “I come here to find the purpose of life. I don’t really care the income or status.” </p></br>
                                                                                <p>“But you know, life is just not a smooth road,” she continued. The Hong Kong-born shop assistant got her first-month salary with about 10% deducted, not because she damaged or lost goods, but because she “was too responsible.” </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Before Choi’s official start date in the contract, the Polish manager told her that she had to take a compulsory 30-minutes lunch break at a specific time; otherwise, her salary would be deducted accordingly. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>She said, “we, Hongkongers, tend to work until we finish the whole thing. So I told the manager that I would be a bit late for lunch and he could still count my lunchtime, which I don’t mind.”</p></br>
                                                                                <p>“But he still deducted my salary and even vented his anger on me occasionally. The emotional manager dislikes Chinese tourists because he thinks they are troublesome and fussy,” she continued. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Despite the challenges ahead of Choi’s, she herself said at least, she had found the meaning of life in Scotland where she wanted to continue her stay after the completion of working holiday. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>“We should all find a place where we belong to. And Edinburg is a comfortable place that I love. People here emphasise the quality of life, unlike the stressful environment in Hong Kong,” she said. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Choi met her Scottish-Chinese boyfriend in one of the Chinese Christian churches in Edinburgh during the trip, saying that she might immigrate to Scotland if the relationship was stable.</p></br>

									<p>Melissa is a final-year International Journalism student of Hong Kong Baptist University. She is now in her 20s and in love with travelling. After going to Sweden as an exchange student in 2016, she suddenly realised the importance of a work-life balance which is something Hongkongers have been struggling with for years. This is how she came up with the idea of honours project: Working Holiday.</p>
