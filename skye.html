                                                                                <p>“Youth is finite. I don’t want to waste my youth and that’s why I want to explore more with my boyfriend who is one of the most important people in my life,” a twenty-something girl said.</p></br>
                                                                                <p>Skye Pang Tse-ting grew up in a traditional village in Fanling. After graduating from college, she was not sure what direction she wanted her career to take until her boyfriend handed me an application form of working holiday. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Pang had one year of working holiday, where she learnt everything from cooking herself to handling other people’s difficult emotions. She said, “the things I’ve learnt during my working holiday journey have become a stepping stone to my current career.”</p></br>
                                                                                <p>The 24-year-old joined cabin crew team of Hong Kong Express after she came back from an exotic island - Australia. She said, “the serving experience at the restaurant and my English proficiency after one-year working holiday do help my career a lot because my job is to provide hospitality and unforgettable customer service to my passengers.”</p></br>
                                                                                <p>Peng and her boyfriend Chan Lok-shun joined the scheme together. They stayed in Melbourne for the first six months in a strawberry farm working as packers and afterwards found a job in a Canberra-based Chinese restaurant. She said, “In Hong Kong, due to the busy schedule and flat size limitation, we rarely live together. But in Australia, it’s much easier.”</p></br>

Throughout the year we spent together, augments give us the chance to see one another as our true selves and make each person realise we still love the other no matter what,” she added.</p></br>
                                                                                <p>“My boyfriend used to be very highly sensitive and feel uncomfortable when I hung out with my friends. If he knew my flight attendant job before working holiday, he would probably chide or show a frowning face,” she continued. “But he is now completely changed. He seems more confident in himself and tries to be a supportive partner.”</p></br>
                                                                                <p>Peng said they have a more satisfying and stable relationship than ever, smiling joyfully.</p></br>

									<p>Melissa is a final-year International Journalism student of Hong Kong Baptist University. She is now in her 20s and in love with travelling. After going to Sweden as an exchange student in 2016, she suddenly realised the importance of a work-life balance which is something Hongkongers have been struggling with for years. This is how she came up with the idea of honours project: Working Holiday.</p>
