                                                                                <p>Earning piles of cash to fund more epic adventures is one of the ultimate goals for working holidayers. But could you imagine getting paid to travel during the journey? It sounds like a dream, but it’s a reality for the 23-year-old who combines work with pleasure. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>With her eloquence and perseverance, Andy Kun On-dik managed to find a tour guide job after working as a sales assistant for about three months. Up to now, she has travelled to more than 25 cities in Europe. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>“My travel dream is like a seed. I’ve had this idea planted in my mind when I was still in the secondary school,” she said. “ I’d never thought of getting paid to travel somewhere I like or even working outside of Hong Kong.”</p></br>
                                                                                <p>“But when you see a chance, just take it,” she added.</p></br>
                                                                                <p>Kun has worked as a part-time tour guide for a Chinese travel agency based in Scotland for almost nine months but she has already become the top-two trip leader in her company. “It’s surprising because I’ve never thought about that outcome,” she said, “People called me knowledgeable and entertaining. But I just do my part and that’s it.” </p></br>

                                                                                <p>Her work starts days before the tour when she needs to check the documents of tourists carefully to make sure the flight tickets are issued with the correct names. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Not only does she remember the tour members’ special needs such as dietary requirements, she is also in charge of making sure that every player is accounted for when they visit and leave on an attraction. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Leading a group of around 40 people is not an easy job, she said. “I have to wake up at four and check everything. Sometimes I even need to wake my tour members up by WeChat call or knocking on their hotel room doors.”</p></br>
                                                                                           
                                                                                <p>Kun embarked on the journey just after being graduated from the City University of Hong Kong in 2016. She said she would stay until her working visa expires. </p></br>

									<p>Melissa is a final-year International Journalism student of Hong Kong Baptist University. She is now in her 20s and in love with travelling. After going to Sweden as an exchange student in 2016, she suddenly realised the importance of a work-life balance which is something Hongkongers have been struggling with for years. This is how she came up with the idea of honours project: Working Holiday.</p>
