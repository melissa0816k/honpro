                                                                                <p>Tired of being stuck in a rut with no chance of promotion, doing the same thing day after day? Dream of packing it all in to hit the road and explore the far corners of the world?</p></br>
                                                                                <p>About one year and nine months ago, Janis Wong Yi-ching did just that, quitting her hospitality job in Island Shangri-La to set off on a journey of growth in England without a specific end date but within her visa’s validity. She revealed how the reality of almost-two-year working holiday trip - while amazing - could be so challenging. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>When, in 2011, Janis had her first job in a hotel working as a receptionist after graduation, working extra hours every single working day seemed to become part of her daily routine. “I had been working in a hotel for more than five years but I couldn’t see any promotion opportunities,” said Wong. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>“I want some changes in my life before the age of 30,” she continued with an affirmative smile. “I’m almost 30 and this might be my last chance to try something different and impulsive.”</p></br>
                                                                                <a href ="emily.html"><p><font face="verdana"><b> A once-in-a-lifetime overseas voluntary experience motivates the thirty-year-old &#8594; </b></font></p></a>

Wong left her Hong Kong-based job and managed to find a full-time job in her friend’s gastropub located in Newcastle.</p></br>

                                                                                <p>Even so, she did not lose her passion for the industry. Continuously sending resumes to let her find the current job - a front desk position in the hotel.  </p></br>

									<p>Melissa is a final-year International Journalism student of Hong Kong Baptist University. She is now in her 20s and in love with travelling. After going to Sweden as an exchange student in 2016, she suddenly realised the importance of a work-life balance which is something Hongkongers have been struggling with for years. This is how she came up with the idea of honours project: Working Holiday.</p>
