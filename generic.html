									<p>Working holiday visas (WHV) gives Hongkongers aged between 18 and 30 a chance to experience day to day life beyond the tourist zone and gain a deeper global awareness and understanding of other cultures. According to last-year statistics from Labour Department, Australia dominated the number of WHV granted to local youths from 2014 to 2016, followed by United Kingdom, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.</p>
						
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>1. Australia</h2>
									<p>Getting a working holiday visa for Australia is almost unbelievably easy since there are 5,000 quota each year. With fantastic national parks, tropical reefs and spectacular sandy beaches, Australia has long been regarded as one of the best countries in the world to live in. According to 2017 liveability report produced by the research group Economist Intelligence Unit, Melbourne was even named the world’s most liveable city for the seventh successive year.</p>  
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>2. United Kingdom</h2>
									<p>The country is probably one of the most popular destinations for Hong Kong young people due to the special post-colonial relationship. Every year more than a thousand of Hongkongers enter the UK with their working holiday visa but some of them do not head straight to the bright lights of London whose cost of living is similar to Hong Kong’s. Instead, many of them go to some small historic cities such as Edinburgh or the lively cities like Newcastle. </p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>3. Japan</h2>
									<p>The figures from the Japanese consulate showed that Hong Kong has been the world’s biggest importer of Japanese foods. From food to comic characters, travel to consumer goods, Japan has always captivated Hongkongers for decades. Since the working holiday scheme between Japan and Hong Kong was launched in 2010, the number of applications received has been increased except a slight drop between 2013 and 2015.</p> 
										
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>4. New Zealand</h2>
									<p>Noted for its tropical beaches and mountain glaciers, this gorgeous country is one of the most popular choices for working holidayers from all over the world. A working holiday visa will last you 12 months and if you’re nature lover, it’s comparatively easy to find seasonal agricultural work such as picking fruits.</p>
									
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>5. South Korea</h2>
									<p>In the 2018 annual Best of Travel report conducted by a leading travel guide, Lonely Planet, South Korea was ranked as number two on Top countries to explore. It is indisputable that the wave of enthusiasm for Korean culture has swept Hong Kong in recent years. The rising popularity of South Korean cultural exports including K-drama, K-pop, K-film and K-fashion might be one of the major reasons why more young locals would consider working in South Korea after the bilateral agreement with the country came into effect in 2011.</p>

									<p>Melissa is a final-year International Journalism student of Hong Kong Baptist University. She is now in her 20s and in love with travelling. After going to Sweden as an exchange student in 2016, she suddenly realised the importance of a work-life balance which is something Hongkongers have been struggling with for years. This is how she came up with the idea of honours project: Working Holiday.</p>
