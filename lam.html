                    <p><b>Reported by Melissa Ko</b></p>
	
									        
                                                                                <p>Every year thousands of young Hongkongers embrace the foreign adventure. Whilst a majority prefer returning home after their working holiday visa expires, Lam Tat-wai chose to stay on permanently. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>“I told my mom that I wanted to explore more instead of staying here for doing something I’m not really into. The workload in Hong Kong is too heavy and the environment is stressful,” he said with a heavy sigh.</p></br>
                                                                                <p>“But my mom seems supportive about my decision and even encourages me to go. Maybe she agrees with me that Hong Kong is really not a suitable or comfortable place to live in," he said after a short pause. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Lam had a clear, detailed plan before he started his single journey to Dublin, the capital of Ireland where he used to have four different low-skilled jobs such as cleaning at the supermarket Tesco before he got hired by the international logistics firm in Shannon. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>He is the only Hong Kong-born worker in the company that offered him a work permit to stay on. </p></br>

                                                                                <p>However, before this job, Lam’s first job was being a waiter at a Chinese hotpot restaurant whose owner only paid him around seven euros per hour while the minimum wage at the time was 9.25 euros.</p></br>
                                                                                <a href ="skye.html"><p><font face="verdana"><b> What has working holiday taught the young couple? &#8594; </b></font></p></a>
                                                                                <p>Lam said, “without PPS (Personal Public Service) number, it’s quite hard to find a job. So when I first came to Ireland, I could not but to work for Chinese people because I got turned down for a shop assistant job.” </p></br>
                                                                                <p>According to the Irish Citizens Information Phone Service (CIPS), everyone who works in Ireland should have specific personal public service number. It is a unique reference number that helps workers access public services, social welfare benefits and information in Ireland.</p><br>
                                                                                <p>Although the official website stated that employers should not look for a job seeker’s PPS number when recruiting, Lam said, “I was treated unfairly. The shop owner rejected my application simply because I could not offer him my PPS number. And he was not willing to write me an employment letter which is a requirement to seek a PPS number.” </p><br>
                                                                                <p>If citizens are taking up employment, they need a PPS number to register with the Revenue Commissioners. </p><br>
                                                                                <p>“The experience was quite frustrating at first. But I know many working holidayer must come across negativity and bias during their journeys, you just need to get over it on your own,” he added. </p><br>
                                                                                <p>He said he would stay until getting the permanent residency in Ireland. After getting the permanent identity card, he might consider travelling back to Hong Kong.</p></br>

									<p>Melissa is a final-year International Journalism student of Hong Kong Baptist University. She is now in her 20s and in love with travelling. After going to Sweden as an exchange student in 2016, she suddenly realised the importance of a work-life balance which is something Hongkongers have been struggling with for years. This is how she came up with the idea of honours project: Working Holiday.</p>
