										<h2 id="content">“Lucky” girl got her first management job in Hong Kong after working holiday </h2>
                    <p><b>Reported by Melissa Ko</b></p>
	
									        
                                                                                <p>“If I had to use only one world to describe my working holiday journey, it would be lucky. The experience I gained from the trip made me have the advantage of finding a more suitable job when I returned to Hong Kong,” the 33-year-old public relation manager said. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Tired of the stressful working environment in Hong Kong, Dorothy Cho Ka-yan and her boyfriend, three years ago, decided to leave the city for a while to refresh their minds and gain some international exposures.</p></br>
                                                                                <p>They chose different destinations. Cho went to the UK while her boyfriend travelled to Germany. She explained, “we both believed that it could make us grow up more and have more topics to share with each other.” </p></br>
                                                                                <p>When Cho landed in London, she sent over a hundred job application emails to potential employers across the UK and one of the jobs she was highly interested in gave a green light to her. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>The manager at the award-winning luxury hotel, Lindeth Fell Country House located in Bowness-on-Windermere contacted her to come to work after an hour phone interview. </p></br>

                                                                                <p>She said, “I was so surprised that my supervisors gave me this, such an important job. Perhaps they know I have some journalistic background.”</p></br>
                                                                                <p>“I was actually benefited from this unique working experience after getting back to Hong Kong and looking for the full-time job,” she continued. “I quickly got my  public relation management job at NGO (Non-governmental organisation) because my employer thought I not only had relevant experience in communication but also had overseas editing experience.” </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Cho, who had worked as an editor and receptionist in the hotel for three months to help the hotel deal with the peak season, described herself as “the luckiest working holidayer in the world” because she was the first and the only working holidayer the hotel has hired so far. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>She was not offered three meals a day but also free accommodation. With spacious garden and elegant decorations, the hotel has left Cho with an extraordinary impression. </p></br>

									<p>Melissa is a final-year International Journalism student of Hong Kong Baptist University. She is now in her 20s and in love with travelling. After going to Sweden as an exchange student in 2016, she suddenly realised the importance of a work-life balance which is something Hongkongers have been struggling with for years. This is how she came up with the idea of honours project: Working Holiday.</p>
