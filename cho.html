										<h2 id="content">“Lucky” girl got her first management job in Hong Kong after working holiday </h2>
                    <p><b>Reported by Melissa Ko</b></p>
	
									        
                                                                                <p>Dorothy Cho Ka-yan, three years ago, decided to leave the city for a year to refresh her minds and gain some international exposures at her age of 30. She now is a public relation manager.</p><br>
                                                                                <p>“If I had to use only one world to describe my working holiday journey, it would be lucky. The experience I gained from the trip made me have the advantage of finding a more suitable job when I returned to Hong Kong,” Cho said. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Tired of the stressful working environment in Hong Kong, Cho and her boyfriend went to different countries to start their working holiday. Cho went to the UK while her boyfriend travelled to Germany. She explained, “we both believed that it could make us grow up more and have more topics to share with each other.” </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Cho worked in the award-winning luxury hotel, Lindeth Fell Country House located in Bowness-on-Windermere during the working holiday period.</p><br>

									<p>Melissa is a final-year International Journalism student of Hong Kong Baptist University. She is now in her 20s and in love with travelling. After going to Sweden as an exchange student in 2016, she suddenly realised the importance of a work-life balance which is something Hongkongers have been struggling with for years. This is how she came up with the idea of honours project: Working Holiday.</p>
