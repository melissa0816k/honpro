                                                                                <p>Although Ng Kai-yeung had travelled to several Asian countries in his twenties, he felt like a babe in the woods when he began his first trip to Europe eight years ago. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>He flied to Ireland in which he found his temporary flyer distribution job and then worked as a waiter at the Chinese restaurant. But the best job he thought might be the graphic design job. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Ng said it was a high-paid and interesting work, which allowed him to earn a substantial amount of money to fund his travel across Europe. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Spending more than four months working for a graphic design firm in Dublin, he was then offered a work permit by his employer but he rejected it because of homesickness. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Ng, 38, said,“I felt so surprised because my employer not only gave me the high salary but also offered a work permit, which was totally out of my expectation,” he said. “But I turned his offer down since I missed my family while being abroad. </p></br>
                                                                                               
                                                                                <p>His design knowledge proved to be a good match for the company’s needs while he was the only Asian foreign worker in the firm. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Of all the things that could be stolen from Ng - his youth, jobs, money- what no one could ever take from him is the solid life experience he gained from working holiday, which has makes him become a more well-rounded person, he said. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>“A one-year overseas experience has definitely broadened my horizons and taught me to keep the passion for life, which has greatly influenced my mindset,” Ng added. “I think I made a right choice at the age of 30.” </p></br>
                                                                                <p>“Without doubt, this is my best decision ever,” Ng said."I knew that when I'm eighty-something, I would never regret trying this thing that I was super excited about,” he added. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Ng now is a part-time lecturer at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, freelance travel writer and presenter in a Passion Times online travel programme called Hongkongers’ desire for travel(港豬想旅行).</p></br>

									<p>Melissa is a final-year International Journalism student of Hong Kong Baptist University. She is now in her 20s and in love with travelling. After going to Sweden as an exchange student in 2016, she suddenly realised the importance of a work-life balance which is something Hongkongers have been struggling with for years. This is how she came up with the idea of honours project: Working Holiday.</p>
