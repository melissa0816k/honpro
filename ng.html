                                                                                <p>Ng said it was a high-paid and interesting work, which allowed him to earn a substantial amount of money to fund his travel across Europe. </p></br>
                                                                                <p>Spending more than four months working for a graphic design firm in Dublin, he was then offered a work permit by his employer but he rejected it because of homesickness. </p></br>
                                                                                <a href ="lam.html"><p><font face="verdana"><b> Home and away: getting a work permit and stay on &#8594; </b></font></p></a>

									<p>Melissa is a final-year International Journalism student of Hong Kong Baptist University. She is now in her 20s and in love with travelling. After going to Sweden as an exchange student in 2016, she suddenly realised the importance of a work-life balance which is something Hongkongers have been struggling with for years. This is how she came up with the idea of honours project: Working Holiday.</p>
